command-description() {
    cat<<MESSAGE
Updates the current branch by rebasing the default upstream branch. Then,
it pushes HEAD to the appropriate upstream branch.

By default, the name of remote branch is equal to the local one. If a local
branch has an upstream branch configured, it will be used as a remote branch.
If you provide a custom name of the remote branch, it will be used as a remote
branch.

If there are uncommitted changes, they will be stashed prior to the command
execution and un-stashed after its successful completion. This is useful if you
need to deliver only sub-set of the changes.

Approximate commands flow is
\`\`\`bash
==>> git elegant deliver-work
git fetch
git rebase origin/master
git push --set-upstream --force origin task-123:task-123
